# Non-developer path — Using a kit

You've forked PrimiBlocks (or someone else's PrimiBlocks-based repo). Goal: render an artifact (a prompt, a config, a test) without writing the vars JSON by hand.

## Install + sanity check

From the repo root:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
primiblocks doctor
```

`doctor` reports a per-check rundown. If anything's not green, fix it before continuing — common issues:

- **`python_version`** not green → install Python 3.11 or newer.
- **`dep_jinja2` / `dep_yaml`** not green → re-run `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- **`kit_dir_exists`** not green → you're not in the repo root, or `kit/` was deleted.

## Pick a template

```bash
primiblocks list templates
```

You'll get a list like:

```
  rag-qa-prompt            (composes: system_persona, retrieval_block, task_instruction, output_format_markdown)
  agent-tool-using-prompt  (composes: system_persona, task_instruction, tool_use_examples, output_format_json, guardrail_refusal)
  eval-judge-prompt        (composes: system_persona, task_instruction, few_shot_block, output_format_json)
```

Pick the one closest to what you want to do.

## Run /primi-fill

In Claude Code:

```
/primi-fill
```

The skill will:

![/primi-fill flow](docs/diagrams/primi-fill-flow.svg)

1. List the templates → ask which one.
2. Fetch that template's **effective contract** (the union of its own variables and every variable contributed by each primitive it composes).
3. Walk you through the variables **one at a time, grouped by primitive**, using each variable's `description` as the question and its constraints to shape the picker.
4. Validate each answer; re-ask on failure with the renderer's error message.
5. Persist your answers to `.primiblocks/runs/<timestamp>/vars.json`.
6. Render the artifact via `primiblocks render`.
7. Show you a preview. You confirm; it writes to a path you specify.

If you cancel at step 7, the vars JSON is still on disk — you can rerun `primiblocks render <template> --vars .primiblocks/runs/<timestamp>/vars.json` later.

## Re-render with tweaked vars

The vars JSON from your last `/primi-fill` is reusable. Edit it directly, then:

```bash
primiblocks render <template> --vars .primiblocks/runs/<timestamp>/vars.json --out my-output.txt
```

Faster than re-walking the skill if you're iterating on one or two answers.

## When something goes wrong

| Symptom                                       | First thing to check                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `primiblocks: command not found`              | `pip install -e ".[dev]"` from the repo root                                                       |
| "missing required variable: 'X'"              | You omitted a required answer in `/primi-fill`. Re-run and answer it.                              |
| "variable 'X' value Y not in enum [...]"      | The value you gave isn't an allowed choice. Pick from the listed options.                          |
| "variable 'X' value Y below min / above max"  | Your numeric answer is out of the declared range. Adjust.                                          |
| "variable 'X' value Y does not match pattern" | Your answer doesn't match the regex. Inspect the pattern in the template's frontmatter.            |
| Rendered output looks empty / garbled         | Run `primiblocks lint --kit-dir kit` — the kit may have a broken primitive include.                |
| Skills don't show up in Claude Code           | Restart Claude Code; verify `.claude/skills/primi-fill/` and `.claude/skills/primi-author/` exist. |

If `primiblocks doctor` is red anywhere, fix that first — it's a faster path to the real cause than tearing into the rendered output.

# Developer path — Building a kit

You've forked PrimiBlocks. Goal: replace the reference LLM-prompt kit in `kit/` with **your** domain — and ship.

## The mental model

PrimiBlocks is **three layers** (see [3-layer architecture](docs/diagrams/3-layer-architecture.svg) in the README):

- **Primitives** — atomic, parameterized Jinja2 fragments under `kit/primitives/*.j2`. Each declares the variables it consumes in YAML frontmatter.
- **Templates** — compositions under `kit/templates/*.j2`. Each declares `primitives: [...]` plus its own variables in frontmatter. The body is Jinja2 that `{% include "primitives/X.j2" %}`s the listed primitives.
- **Skills** — `/primi-fill` and `/primi-author` (Claude Code), wrapping the bundled CLI.

The renderer computes the **effective contract** before validating supplied vars:

![Effective contract aggregation](docs/diagrams/effective-contract-aggregation.svg)

When a template lists `primitives: [foo, bar]`, the renderer takes the union of the template's own vars and each primitive's vars. On name collision, the **template's** declaration replaces the primitive's entirely — letting template authors tighten constraints, change defaults, or rename without forking the primitive. This is [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-primitives-carry-contracts-that-bubble-up.md).

## Contract grammar reference

Every primitive and template carries YAML frontmatter fenced by `---`. Schema:

```yaml
---
description: One-line summary of what this primitive/template emits.   # required
primitives:                                                            # templates only; optional
  - retrieval_block
  - output_format_json
vars:                                                                  # optional
  - name: index_name             # required
    type: string                 # required: string|int|float|bool|list|path|enum
    description: …               # required (drives the fill-skill's question)
    required: true               # default true
    default: null                # used when required: false and var omitted
    examples: ["prod-docs"]      # informational only
    enum: ["prod-docs", "staging-docs"]   # optional constraint
    min: 1                       # optional; int/float value; list length
    max: 50                      # optional; int/float value; list length
    pattern: "^[a-z0-9-]+$"      # optional; regex for string-shaped types
---
```

Notes:

- **`description` is mandatory** on every variable. The fill-skill uses it as the question.
- **`pattern` applies** to `string`, `enum`, and `path` types. It does *not* apply to int/float (use `min`/`max` instead).
- **`min`/`max` on lists** check the list's length (not element values).
- **`int` explicitly rejects `bool`** at validation (Python's `isinstance(True, int)` is True; we guard against that silent bug).
- **`path` is string-shaped** — we don't check filesystem existence at render time.
- **Defaults bypass type-checking** today (an author who sets `default: "foo"` on a `type: list` won't be told). This is a known sharp edge; the linter may catch it in a later version.

## Authoring a primitive

A primitive is one `.j2` file under `kit/primitives/`. Minimal example:

```jinja2
---
description: Inserts a retrieval-grounded context block.
vars:
  - name: index_name
    type: string
    description: Name of the index to query.
    pattern: "^[a-z0-9-]+$"
  - name: top_k
    type: int
    description: How many chunks to retrieve.
    min: 1
    max: 50
    default: 5
    required: false
---
## Retrieved context (index={{ index_name }}, top_k={{ top_k }})

<<RETRIEVED_CHUNKS>>
```

The body is plain Jinja2. Variables you reference (`{{ index_name }}`, `{{ top_k }}`) must appear in your contract.

Scaffold a stub with:

```bash
primiblocks new primitive my_primitive
```

## Authoring a template

A template is one `.j2` file under `kit/templates/`. It composes primitives via `primitives:` frontmatter + `{% include %}` in the body:

```jinja2
---
description: A retrieval-augmented QA prompt with a structured markdown answer.
primitives:
  - system_persona
  - retrieval_block
  - task_instruction
  - output_format_markdown
vars:
  - name: question
    type: string
    description: The user's question.
---
{% include "primitives/system_persona.j2" %}
{% include "primitives/retrieval_block.j2" %}
{% include "primitives/task_instruction.j2" %}
{% include "primitives/output_format_markdown.j2" %}

## User question

{{ question }}
```

The `primitives:` frontmatter and the `{% include %}` statements **must agree** — the linter catches drift in either direction. Scaffold a stub with:

```bash
primiblocks new template my_template
```

### Overriding a primitive's var

If a template needs a tighter constraint than the primitive provides, declare a `vars:` entry in the template's frontmatter with the same `name`:

```yaml
primitives: [retrieval_block]
vars:
  - name: top_k
    type: int
    description: Tighter bound for this template.
    min: 1
    max: 10        # primitive allowed up to 50; template tightens to 10
    default: 3
```

The template's declaration **replaces** the primitive's entirely (no field-level merge). This is the *only* mechanism for diverging from a primitive's contract — never inline-edit the primitive itself for a one-off template.

## Using /primi-author

When the new template is non-trivial, drive the authoring via the skill:

![/primi-author flow](docs/diagrams/primi-author-flow.svg)

1. Tell the skill what you want.
2. It lists available primitives.
3. You pick and order them.
4. You override any vars you want.
5a. If a needed primitive doesn't exist → it writes `kit/requests/<slug>.md`. Stop until a developer fulfills the request.
5b. If everything exists → it writes `kit/templates/<name>.j2`.
6. It runs `primiblocks lint` against the new template and stops only when clean.

## The renderer's module map

For contributors changing renderer internals:

![Module dependency graph](docs/diagrams/renderer-module-dep-graph.svg)

- `errors.py` — typed errors. Independent.
- `_frontmatter.py` — split YAML frontmatter from Jinja2 body. Internal.
- `contract.py` — `Contract.parse` + `Contract.validate`. Type + constraint enforcement.
- `primitives.py` — discover `kit/primitives/*.j2`, parse contracts.
- `templates.py` — discover `kit/templates/*.j2`, compute effective contract.
- `render.py` — orchestrate validate → Jinja2 render. `FrontmatterAwareLoader` strips frontmatter from `{% include %}`'d files.
- `cli.py` — argparse + `--json` envelope.
- `lint.py` — kit-wide drift and orphan checks.
- `scaffold.py` — `new template` / `new primitive` stubs.

## CLI subcommand reference

Every subcommand supports `--json` (returns `{"ok": bool, "data"?: …, "error"?: {kind, message}}`) and `--kit-dir <path>` (default: `./kit`).

| Command                                          | What it does                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `primiblocks render <T> --vars FILE [--out FILE]`| Render template `T` against vars in FILE; write to stdout or `--out`.                  |
| `primiblocks validate <T> --vars FILE`            | Validate vars against `T`'s effective contract without rendering.                       |
| `primiblocks contract <T>`                        | Dump `T`'s effective contract (used by skills to drive walkthroughs).                   |
| `primiblocks lint`                                | Kit-wide checks: drift, broken includes, missing descriptions, orphan primitives.     |
| `primiblocks list templates \| primitives`        | Enumerate the kit's contents with each item's vars / primitives.                        |
| `primiblocks new template \| primitive <name>`    | Scaffold a lint-clean stub at the right path.                                          |
| `primiblocks doctor`                              | Diagnose Python version, deps, kit layout, lint clean.                                 |

Exit codes:

- **0** — success
- **1** — contract / render / validation / lint error
- **2** — usage error (argparse)

## The linter

`primiblocks lint` emits two severities:

- **error** — something the renderer would refuse at run time
  - `frontmatter-include-drift` — a primitive is in `primitives:` but not `{% include %}`'d, or vice versa
  - `broken-include` — referenced primitive not on disk
- **warning** — something the renderer tolerates but worth knowing
  - `orphan-primitive` — primitive exists but no template composes it

The CI smoke test (`tests/test_reference_kit.py`) asserts the reference kit lints clean on every PR.

## Troubleshooting with `doctor`

When something is off, `primiblocks doctor` is the fastest triage:

```
  ✓  python_version          3.13.13
  ✓  dep_jinja2              importable
  ✓  dep_yaml                importable
  ✓  kit_dir_exists          kit
  ✓  kit_primitives_dir      kit/primitives
  ✓  kit_templates_dir       kit/templates
  ✓  kit_lint_clean          0 errors, 0 warnings

primiblocks: all checks passed.
```

A failed check tells you exactly which assumption is broken. Common fixes:

- **Old Python** → `pyenv install 3.13` (or your tool of choice) and re-create the venv.
- **Missing deps** → `pip install -e ".[dev]"` from the repo root.
- **Missing kit/** → you're outside a forked repo, or `kit/` was deleted.
- **Lint not clean** → run `primiblocks lint` for the specific issues.
